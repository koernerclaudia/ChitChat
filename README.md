# ChitChat - Native Mobile App, built with ReactNative


## Project Details:

This is another app I created uring my studies with CareerFoundry. 

The task was to build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## TechStack:

- **Build**: ReactNative with Expo
- ** UI Libraries**: GiftedChat (and more...) Navigation, Maps...
- **Data storage**: Google Firebase
- **Testing**: iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, iPhone 14

## Key features & Components:

- A Welcome Screen (Screen 1 of 2) where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat (Screen 2 of 2).
- The app authenticates users anonymously via Google Firebase authentication.
- This 2nd screen displaying the conversation between chat members.
- People can send
    - text messages
    - images from their local photo library app
    - take images and send them
    - send their location (map integration, connection to native map app).
- Data can be stored online (Firebase Cloud Storage) and offline, users can clear the screen.
- extra: I have added system messages that show when a person has entered the chat.

## WIP features:

- Names of Chat participants are appearing in the speech bubbles, but not yet when imagery / maps are sent.
- CSS needs to be fixed a bit for light/ dark background adjustment.


## Tools & resources used

- Testing: 
    - Android Emulator / Android Studio // https://developer.android.com/studio; 
    - iOS Simulator // via Xcode on Mac
    - iPhone 14 / ExpoGo App
- CLI: Expo Dev & SDKs // https://expo.dev/
- Metro Bundler (starting up the project on different platforms)
- Code Editor: VS-Code
- Gifted Chat: Mobile UI Library
- GenAI: Chat GPT & Claude to figure out coding patterns and methods and add other small features


## Deployment / Setup the app (status October 2024)

#### 1. Download the repo 

or create a branch and set up the project locally.

#### 2. Get an Expo account and download the app on your phone.
https://expo.dev/

#### 3. Navigate to where you downloaded/ set up the project locally. Set up this particular version of Node.

````
nvm install 16.19.0
nvm use 16.19.0
nvm alias default 16.19.0
````

#### 4. Set up Expo

To create new projects and start running Expo, youâ€™ll need to install the Expo CLI on your machine. (Use your credentials to log into Expo via the CLI)

````
npm install -g expo-cli
expo login
````

#### 5. Create an Expo project

````
npx create-expo-app chitchat --template
`````
pick the option for: Blank

#### 6. Check the Package.Json file for dependencies and install them via npm

Gifted Chat
````
npm install react-native-gifted-chat --save
````
Firebase (Google Database Storage)
````
npm install firebase@10.3.1 --save

````
React Native Navigaton
````
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
`````

#### 7. Set up Google Firebase

- Go to: https://firebase.google.com/ and log into the console
- Create a new project and name it (disable Google Analytics)
- Go to Build -> Firestore Database -> Create Database -> Pick region
- Choose 'in production mode' -> Next
- Go to 'Rules'
- Set below line in the configuration to 'true':
````
allow read, write: if false;
````
- Then -> Publish.

- Then set up a collection for 'messages'. The app already includes all the code for the collection to be filled automatically.

- You will find the Firebase configuration info in the App.js file:
````
 // Firebase configuration
  const firebaseConfig = {}
````


#### 8. Run the project
````
npx expo start
````
This command will bring up a list of other commands you can use to start your project on simulators and emulators.

#### 9. Use Emulators

- Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio
and follow this guide to set up a virtual device:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds

- Xcode - iOS (Mac Users only)
````
xcode-select --install
open -a Simulator
````
