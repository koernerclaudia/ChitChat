before joining the chat (Screen 2 of 2).
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
- Data can be stored online and offline.


## Technical Requirements

- The app must be written in React Native.
- The app must be developed using Expo.
- The app must be styled according to the given screen design.
- Chat conversations must be stored in Google Firestore Database.
